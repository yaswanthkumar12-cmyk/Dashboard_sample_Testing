Perfect! Let’s create a **concrete, real-time example project** so you can **clearly see how branches, commits, and merge strategies work** in DevOps.

---

## **Project Setup Example**

### **Scenario**

* Project: `Dashboard_sample_Testing`
* Main branch: `main`
* Team: 3 developers

  * **Yaswanth** → feature/login
  * **Ksekhar** → feature/shopping-cart
  * **DevOps** → release prep

---

### **Step 1: Create new branches from main**

```bash
# From main
git checkout main

# Small feature by Yaswanth
git checkout -b feature/login-button

# Big team feature by Ksekhar
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/shopping-cart

# Release preparation branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
```

---

### **Step 2: Commits in branches**

#### **feature/login-button**

```
C1: Add login form
C2: Validate input
C3: Add error messages
```

#### **feature/shopping-cart**

```
C4: Add cart page layout
C5: Connect cart API
C6: Add cart summary
```

#### **release/v1.2.0**

```
C7: Merge latest main features
C8: Final bug fixes for release
```

---

### **Step 3: Merge strategies**

| Branch                | Merge strategy | Result in main                   |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| feature/login-button  | Squash & Merge | Single commit `S1` (clean main)  |
| feature/shopping-cart | Merge Commit   | All commits C4, C5, C6 + merge M |
| release/v1.2.0        | Rebase & Merge | Linear commits C7', C8'          |

---

### **Step 4: Main branch after merges**

```
main
  |
  |-- S1 (login-button, squashed)
  |
  |-- C4 -- C5 -- C6 -- M (shopping-cart, merge commit)
  |
  |-- C7' -- C8' (release prep, rebased linear)
```

---

### ✅ **Key takeaways**

1. **Branch naming matters** (`feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`)
2. **Merge strategy depends on scenario** (daily small PR, big team feature, release prep)
3. **Pre-commit hooks** and `.gitignore` help enforce rules **before merge**
4. **Branches can be deleted** after merge to keep repo clean

If you want, I can make a **visual diagram of this project**, showing **branches, commits, merges, and strategies** all in one picture—like a real DevOps workflow map.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
